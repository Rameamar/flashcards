Who formalized the algorithm concept?	Church and Turing in 1930s
Features of an equivalence relation?	Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive.
What are "connected components" in the dynamic connectivity context?	Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected.
How is implemented the "Find query" in Union-Find?	Check if two objects are in the same connected component.
How is implemented the "Union command" in Union-Find?	Replace components containing two objects with their union.
<div>How many connected components result after performing the following sequence of union operations on a set of 10 items?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>1-2 &nbsp;3-4 &nbsp;5-6 &nbsp;7-8 &nbsp;7-9 &nbsp;2-8 &nbsp;0-5 &nbsp;1-9</div>	3
What's the eager algorithm to solve the dynamic connectivity problem?	Quick-find.
What's the data structure that support the Quick-find algorithm?	An integer array indexed by objects initialized with the same values than the objects.
How the quick-find algorithm implements the find query?	Checks whether the value of the two objects in the ID array is the same, i.e. if they are in the same connected component.
How is implemented the union command by the quick-find algorithm?	Change all entries with id[p] to id[q].
Number of array accesses of the quick-find algorithm	Initialize: N, Find: 2, Union: 2N + 2
What's the defect of quick-find	Union is too expensive. Takes N<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(quadratic) array accesses to process sequence of N union commands on N objects.
<div>What is the maximum number of id[] array entries that can change during one call to union when using the quick-find data structure on N elements?</div>	N - 1
What's the problem with quadratic algorithms?	Quadratic algorithms don't scale with technology. New computers may be 10x as fast, but has 10x much memory. With quadratic algorithm, take 10x longer.
What's the lazy approach to implement Union-Find?	Quick-union algorithm.
What's the data structure used by the Quick-union algorithm?	Integer array id[] of size N. id[i] is parent of i.
<div>Suppose that in a quick-union data structure on 10 elements that the id[] array is</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 9 6 5 4 2 6 1 0 5</div><div><br /></div><div>What are the roots of 3 and 7, respectively?</div><div><br /></div>	6 and 6.
How the find operation is implemented by the Quick-union algorithm?	Check if p and q have the same root.
How is implemented the union command by the Quick-union algorithm?	To merge components containing p and q, set the id of p's root to the id of q's root.
What's the defect of Quick-union algorithm?	Trees can get tall, so find command is too expensive (could be N array access).
<div>What is the maximum number of array accesses during a find operation when using the quick-union data structure on N elements?</div>	Linear.
